# WormtailBot
A multithreaded twitch bot 

Not done yet, i've been working on this for a couple hours to understand how the crate works with threads.
i'll maybe make it so the controller can turn on / off instances of the bot (for multiple channels)

Atm, the bot works, you can control it by typing commands in the console or in twitch chat
