# WormtailBot
A multithreaded twitch bot 

Not done yet, i've been working on this for a couple hours to understand how the crate works with threads.
i'll maybe make it so the controller can turn on / off instances of the bot (for multiple channels)

Atm, the bot works, you can control it by typing commands in the console or in twitch chat

Update:
restructured the code and worked a bit on a app system that manage both the client side controller and the bot
could be upgrded to manage more bots with some cd-like command to switch bot and manage what bot can output data

controller's commands


Todo:
clean a bit the raw api calls
